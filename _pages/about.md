My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning in the context of mobile perception systems. Currently, I am working on deep learning methods for 3D scene understanding to enable map-less driving or self-localization in sparse planning maps. In particular, I am interested in exploring how to overcome data shortage by leveraging the 6D pose awareness of mobile systems in highly accurate semantic 3D maps . Exampels of my current research are:

* Map Learning: Automatic data generation for deep learning applications using HD maps and multi-drive mapping
* Leveraging Map Learning for self-localisation, semantic mapping and map-less driving
* Learning-based 3D scene understanding
